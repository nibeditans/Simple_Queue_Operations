# Simple_Queue_Operations
This program implements a simple queue data structure using Python. It provides basic operations such as pushing elements, popping the first element, accessing the front and last elements, displaying the queue, and exiting the program..


It allows you to perform the following operations:

1. Push Elements: Add an element to the end of the queue.
2. Pop First Element: Remove the first element from the queue.
3. Front Element: Display the first element in the queue.
4. Last Element: Display the last element in the queue.
5. Display Queue: Print the elements of the queue.
6. Exit: Terminate the program.

## How to Use

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
2. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number when prompted.
3. Follow the instructions to perform the desired operation on the queue.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you choose the "Exit" option to terminate the program.

Note: This implementation assumes that the user will only input integers for simplicity. You can modify it to handle other data types if needed.
